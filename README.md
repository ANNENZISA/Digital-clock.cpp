# Digital-clock.cpp
Creating a real-time digital clock in C++ for the console may not provide the most accurate real-time updates due to limitations in console-based applications. However, you can create a simple program that displays the current time and updates periodically. Note that this will not be perfectly real-time. 
This is a basic example using the <ctime> library for time-related functions.
This program continuously updates and displays the current time every second. Keep in mind that the accuracy of real-time updates in a console application can be affected by the system's processing time.
You can stop the program by manually terminating it (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C in the console). Adjustments and improvements can be made based on your specific requirements or the graphical environment you are working with.
